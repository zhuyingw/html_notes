            <p>Hello, this is ok, this is just a website for me to keep notes during 
                my journey in learning HTML. <strong>YAY</strong>
            </p>
        </body>
    <h1 id="TOP"> Let's do some HTML</h1>
    <h2> HTML study notes</h2>
    <body>
        <p>This indicates the start of the paragraph. We can emphasize 
        using <strong>STRONG as key word</strong>. We can also italicize words
        by using the keyword <em>em.</em>
        </p>

        <!--and this is the way to make comment in html-->

        <p>We can begin another paragraph and explore about list:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This is an unordered list</li>
            <li>It will begin with a bullet point</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are also ordered list:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>This will have number listed from 1</li>
        </ol>
    </body>

    <h2>Links</h2>
    <body>
        <p>
            There are different types of links:
        <ul>
            <li>link to pages on other websites on the Internet</li>
            <li>links to other pages on the same websites</li>
            <li><em>Absolute</em>vs. <em>relative</em> links</li>
                <p>Aboslute Links are links to pages on other websites. A typical absolute link is made up
                    with 3 parts - <strong>protocol://domain/path</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Relative links are link to other pages of the same website, such as 
                    <a href="./Pages/about.html">About</a>, where we only specify it's location
                    relative to the current directory.
                </p>
            <li>Display an image on webpage using HTML</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </body>
    <h3>Link test</h3>
    <body>
        <p><strong> <em>a</em></strong> tag can be used for a link, such as
            <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">click me</a>
        </p>
    </body>

    <h2>Images</h2>
    <body>
        <p>
            Use <strong>img</strong> to get pictures in the website. The <strong>img</strong> tag
            is self-closing, so it does NOT need a closing tag. It embeds an image into the page 
            using a src attribute, which can work like link with both absolute and rleative paths.
        </p>
        <p>
            4 formats of images can be used in HTML:
            <ul>
                <li>JPG</li>
                <li>GIF</li>
                <li>PNG</li>
                <li>SVG</li>
            </ul>
