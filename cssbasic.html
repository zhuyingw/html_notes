    <h2 id="top">Basic Syntax</h2>
    <p>
        The Syntax of each declaration is as such:<strong>property:value pair</strong>.
    </p>

    <div>
        We see that <strong><em>div</em></strong> is simply an empty container. It
    is good practice to use other containers like <em>h1</em>,<em>p</em>, etc. However,
    as we learn about CSS, div might come handy. 
    </div>

    <h2>Selector</h2>
    <p>
        Selectors simply refer to the HTML element to which CSS rules apply, they are what is 
        being "selected" for the rule. There are many different kinds of selectors, the following 
        is no the whole list:
        <ul>
            <li>Universal Selector</li>
            <p>This selector will select elements of any type. Here is an example:</p>
            <p>
                *{color:purple;}
            </p>

            <li>Type Selector</li>
            <p>This is applied to all elements of the selected type, such as </p>
            <p>
                div {
                    color: purple;
                }
            </p>

            <li>Class Selector <em>.alert-text</em></li>
            <li>ID Selector <em>#title</em></li>
                <p>
                    The major difference between classes and IDs is that an element can <strong>only have one ID,</strong>
                    an ID cannot be repeated on a single page, but class does not have to be unique and can be repeated.
                </p>
            <li>Grouping Selector <em>.read,.unread</em></li>
            <li>Chaining Selector</li>
            <li>Descendant Combinator</li>
                <p>
                    This is used for <em>nested classes.</em>
                </p>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Some Properties of CSS</h2>
        <p id="try1" style="color:coral; background-color:cornflowerblue">The playground of trying out different properties</p>
        <p id="try2">We can change the font, font size, bold (font weight). Lastly, we can put this line in the center</p>
        <p class="toRight">Or to the right</p>
        <p>Let's play with some images and more:</p>

    <h2>Ok, back to business</h2>
    <p>
        CSS can sometimes seem non-conform with the order, that can be because of the default styles 
        of the browser - <strong>the concept of cascade</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The cascade is what determines which rules actually get applied to HTML. It also
        follows some rules:
        <ol>
            <li>Specificity</li>
            <p>ID selector > class selector > type selector</p>
            <p>and when the selectors are the same, the tie-breaker is the <em>number</em>. The ones with
            more amount wins the priority.</p>
            <li>Inheritance</li>
            <p>
                Typography based properties (color, font-size, font-family, etc) are usually inherited,
                while most other properties are not. But, as usual, we can override the Inheritance by directly
                target at it. 
            </p>
            <li>Rule Order</li>
            <p>
                The tie-breaker of the tie-breaker is the order: <em>last defined</em> is the winner.
            </p>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Adding CSS to HTML</h2>
    <p>
        There are 3 ways of doing it: <strong>External CSS, Internal CSS </strong>, and <strong> Inline CSS</strong>.
    </p>
    <img class="csstohtml" src="./PIC/external.png">
    <p>
        <em>rel</em> attribute is required, and it specifies the relationship between the HTML file and the linked file.
    </p>

    <img class="csstohtml large" src="./PIC/inline.png">
    <p>Pay careful attention as inline CSS will override the other two methods.</p>
